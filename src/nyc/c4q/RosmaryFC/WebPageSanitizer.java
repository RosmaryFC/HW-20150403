/**
 * 2. Sanitizing web pages

 Search engines like Google have programs called web-scapers which visit webpages and scrape
 the information displayed on the webpage.
 The displayable information is contained in html tags like p, table, h2 etc.
 When we make a GET request for a webpage, the HTML that is returned can also contain tags
 like script which often do not correspond to the displayable content on the webpage.
 Information inside script tags is not used by scapers and they often ignore these tags in the HTML.
 Write a class called WebPageSanitizer which implements a static method called
 String sanitize(String html) which removes all script tags and the information that
 they encapsulate and returns a sanitized version of the HTML string.
