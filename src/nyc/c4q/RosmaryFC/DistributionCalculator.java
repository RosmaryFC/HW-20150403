/**
 * 3. Character Distributions

 Create a class to calculate the distribution of characters in the contents of a text file.
 Your class called DistributionCalculator should implement a method calculate(File textFile)
 which accepts as input a Text file. It reads the contents of the file and returns an ArrayList
 which contains the distribution/percentage of characters (a-z) in the text file.
 You should lowercase lines before you do the calculation.
 Call the calculate method from main and print the distribution.
 You can ignore characters which do not belong in the range(a-z) for doing your calculation.
 Your program's output should look something like:

 a = 14.44 %
 b = 6.02 %
 ...
 ...
 z = 0.05 %

public class DistributionCalculator {
    public static void main (String[] args) {

    }
    public static ArrayList calculate (File textFile) {

        return null;
    }
}
